    <h1 class="points">What I've learned this this:</h1>
      <h3 class="answer">1) Thus far it's been a pleasant review to refresh what I've "learned" from the Udemy intro.  As for now, it's all about practice and experience, but I'm confident I'll get there.

    <h2 class="points">Week 1 Challenges:</h2>
    <h3 class="answer">1) My biggest challenge this week is conscious incompetence.  I am quite aware of what I don't know -- which is a lot!
      <br>
      <br>
      2) My other challenge this week is transfering information to long term memory.  I know what I want to do and know that I've seen how it's done, but can't seem to recall the information when I need it.

    <h2 class ="points">What I'm looking forward to learning:</h2>
    <h3 class="answer">1) My first goal is to become more proficient in JavaScript.  It's been quite a learning curve thus far and am looking forward to learning the language and utilize it within web development
      <br>
      <br>
        2) I'm excited to learn how to connect front end web development with the backend.  While it's a large task, I'm confident the end result will feel victorious.
